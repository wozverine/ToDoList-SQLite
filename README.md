# ToDoList-SQLite
UPSchool Homework 3
<p>
  <h4>Welcome to the To Do List app â€” In this homework, I used RecyclerView and database to create a basic to do list app with Kotlin. 
    I used SharedPreferences to store username derived from e-mail adress. RecyclerView shows item and descriptions added by the user. The information is stored on SQLite. </p>
